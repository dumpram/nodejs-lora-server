 * end-device downlink from the network server (FCntDown), which is incremented by the  
 * network server. The network server tracks the uplink frame counter and generates the  
 * downlink counter for each end-device. After a join accept, the frame counters on the end-
 * device and the frame counters on the network server for that end-device are reset to 0.  
 * Subsequently FCntUp and FCntDown are incremented at the sender side by 1 for each data  
 * frame sent in the respective direction. At the receiver side, the corresponding counter is  
 * kept in sync with the value received provided the value received has incremented compared 
 * to the current counter value and is less than the value specified by MAX_FCNT_GAP 1 after 
 * considering counter rollovers. If this difference is greater than the value of MAX_FCNY_GAP 
 * then too many data frames have been lost then subsequent will be discarded. 
 * The LoRaWAN allows the use of either 16-bits or 32-bits frame counters. The network side  
 * needs to be informed out-of-band about the width of the frame counter implemented in a  
 * given end-device. If a 16-bits frame counter is used, the FCnt field can be used directly as  
 * the counter value, possibly extended by leading zero octets if required. If a 32-bits frame  
 * counter is used, the FCnt field corresponds to the least-significant 16 bits of the 32-bits  
 * frame counter (i.e., FCntUp for data frames sent uplink and FCntDown for data frames sent
